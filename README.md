# EEJupyter
As I prepare to work on my PYNQ board, I'm making an effort to get familiar with Jupyter and Python syntax before jumping in headfirst. This program will incorporate common EE formulas, user input, and a pretty output.

## Initial Functionality
- Graphs an RC circuit at switch action with a chosen resistor (Ω), capacitor (F), and voltage source (V) value.
- Sets the accuracy of measurement with the number of points

## Functionality Under Consideration
- Prints a table of common time constants such as 1.4τ, 2.2τ, 5τ, etc.
- Ask the user for a frequency and provide phase angle and impedance
- Implement crystal measurement functionality
- Maybe I should just move on over to Vivado already. That's why I'm getting used to Jupyter anyway.
