# EEJupyter
This is an effort to get familiar with Jupyter and Python syntax. This program incorporates common EE formulas, user input, and a pretty output.

## Initial Functionality
- Graphs the voltage accross a capacitor over time in an RC circuit starting with a chosen resistor (Ω), capacitor (F), and voltage source (V) value.
- Ability to set the accuracy of measurement with the number of points.

## Functionality Under Consideration
- Print a table of the capacitor's voltage around common time constants such as 1.4τ, 2.2τ, 5τ, etc.
- Ask the user for a frequency and provide phase angle and impedance
- Implement crystal measurement functionality
- Maybe I should just move on over to Vivado already. That's why I'm getting used to Jupyter anyway.
